# Communications

A prototype for a communications page for a community, which for now is focusing on:

- A decision log - Where signed in users can post decisions and everyone can read them.
- A chatroom - Where everyone can communicate with each other.

# TODO

- Internationalisation
- Implement it so new decision logs are announced in the chat
